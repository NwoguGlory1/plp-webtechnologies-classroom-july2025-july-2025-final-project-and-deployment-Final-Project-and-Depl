## Development Process
Repository Initialization

Initialized the project locally and created a main branch.

Set up the basic folder structure with index.html, css/, and assets/.

Linked the local repository to a remote one on GitHub.

Version Control with Git

Created a develop branch locally, then created separate feature branches for each section of the site.

After completing work on a feature branch, I pushed it to the develop branch, deleted the old feature branch, and started a fresh one for the next feature.

Maintained a clean commit history using Git.

Merged the develop branch into main after final edits to HTML and CSS and after updating the README.md file.

Feature Branching Workflow

Created isolated branches for individual features (e.g., feature/about-section, feature/projects, etc.).

Developed each section (Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact) independently.

Merged completed features into the main branch after testing and review.

Responsive Design

Implemented CSS media queries to ensure mobile and desktop compatibility.

Utilized semantic HTML5 and CSS Flexbox/Grid for proper layout structuring.

Polishing & Testing

Validated HTML/CSS syntax and ensured responsive design across devices.

Verified all external/internal links (GitHub, LinkedIn, downloadable CV, contact form) were working correctly.
